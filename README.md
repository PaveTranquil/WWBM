The game «Who Wants to Be a Millionaire» has known by its history, hosts, interesting questions: there was times, when it names «О, Счастливчик» and «Горячее кресло» in Russian. The game was going from generation to generation, but now the game's ratings have dropped a lot, there is a lot of water in the game, but it is still dearly loved by its fans.

Did you think about the game's interface and its look? They are very simple and simultaneously thoughtful. On the right there is a money tree with 15 questions, above the tree there are hints, under it there are a question and four answers. But did you think how looks like the host's monitor during the game? It looks like a player monitor, but on the top left there are 6 squares with the following indicators: a number of question to win, an amount available to the player, the amount of a current question, guaranteed amount available to the player and correct answer. After the answer there is a help showing to the host, so that the host has the opportunity to get smart.

I am ready to make the player's and host's interfaces during the game. Obviously, in my project I plan to use two QMainWindow, which have two QWidget: for example, widget with a question with answers, widget with the money tree and etc. Dialog boxes will be available for confirming the player's actions too. Interfaces will be fully functional, it means questions will be showing during the game, you will be able to answer them, use hints, leave the game with the available prize, save prizes to the table of results to make new records. Also you will be able to use a host monitor. With it you will be able to play games with two monitors.

Project will have the data base with questions for every number of a question in the money tree, answers, correct answer and help for host. Also the data base will have the table of results, which you will be able to clean and add new results of the N best games.
